What this script does:


Requirements:
1. Add the folowing API key(s) in your .env file:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - AGENTOPS_API_KEY
2. 

Note: 
If you are running playground examples in the project files directly (without swarms installed via PIP),
make sure to add the project root to your PYTHONPATH by running the following command in the project's root directory:
  'export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH'

Swarm of developers that write documentation and tests for a given code snippet.

This is a simple example of how to use the swarms library to create a swarm of developers that write documentation and tests for a given code snippet.

The swarm is composed of two agents:
    - Documentation agent: writes documentation for a given code snippet.
    - Tests agent: writes tests for a given code snippet.

The swarm is initialized with a language model that is used by the agents to generate text. In this example, we use the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

Agent:
Documentation agent -> Tests agent
